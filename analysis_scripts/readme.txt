isoform_analysis.tar.gz 

Description: Zipped TAR file containing scripts for analyzing circRNA isoforms detected by isoCirc. Functions of scripts include:

* assignment of isoform IDs to circRNA isoforms in isoCirc output file 
* visualization of various statistics of circRNA isoforms (e.g., exon number per isoform, transcript length per isoform, 
read count per isoform, etc.)
* identification of tissue-specific and tissue-stable circRNA isoforms using isoCirc output for sequencing of 12 human tissues
* visualization of proportions of circRNA isoforms across 12 human tissues for a user-specific gene of interest

Details of each script can be found in README files contained within the TAR.
Decompress the file by running: tar -zxvf isoform_analysis.tar.gz
